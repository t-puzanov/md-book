<h2>Fundamental Principles of the Model</h2>
<p><strong>The Big Bang Theory</strong> (ΛCDM model) represents the prevailing cosmological framework describing the universe's evolution from an initial singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This comprehensive model explains several critical phenomena: the expansion of space-time itself, the nucleosynthesis of light elements during the universe's infancy, and the subsequent formation of cosmic structures through gravitational collapse. Contemporary cosmology posits that the universe transitioned from an extremely hot, dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since, with cosmic microwave background radiation serving as the &quot;afterglow&quot; of the primordial fireball.</p>
<p>The inflationary epoch, occurring within the first fraction of a second, remains one of the most fascinating aspects of this model. During this period, the universe underwent exponential expansion, increasing in size by a factor of at least 10²⁶ in less than 10⁻³² seconds. This rapid inflation explains the observed large-scale isotropy of the universe and provides the primordial density fluctuations that later seeded galaxy formation. Quantum fluctuations during inflation became imprinted on the fabric of space-time, creating the initial density variations that would eventually evolve into the cosmic web of galaxies and galaxy clusters we observe today.</p>

<h3>Cosmic Evolution Through the Aeons</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>380,000 years</strong>: <strong>Recombination epoch</strong> - The universe cools sufficiently for electrons to combine with protons, forming neutral hydrogen atoms. This phase transition renders the universe transparent, releasing the cosmic microwave background radiation we detect today. The temperature at this critical juncture was approximately 3,000 K, with the universe spanning about 42 million light-years across.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>150-200 million years</strong>: <strong>Cosmic Dawn</strong> - Gravity amplifies density fluctuations in the dark matter distribution, leading to the collapse of the first protogalactic clouds. Within these primordial structures, Population III stars ignite—massive, metal-free stars that begin synthesizing heavier elements through nuclear fusion. These stellar furnaces fundamentally alter the chemical composition of the cosmos, seeding the interstellar medium with carbon, oxygen, and other elements essential for planet formation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1 billion years</strong>: <strong>Reionization era</strong> - Intense ultraviolet radiation from the first stars and quasars ionizes the neutral hydrogen that permeated the intergalactic medium. This epoch marks the emergence of discernible galactic structures as matter coalesces into distinct spiral and elliptical formations under the influence of dark matter halos. The Hubble Ultra-Deep Field observations capture galaxies from this formative period, revealing their irregular morphologies and intense star-forming activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>9.2 billion years</strong>: <strong>Solar system formation</strong> - Within the molecular cloud of the Milky Way's Orion Arm, gravitational instabilities trigger the collapse of a solar nebula. The majority of its mass concentrates at the center to form the Sun, while residual material in the protoplanetary disk accretes into planetesimals and eventually planets. Earth's position within the circumstellar habitable zone allows for liquid water and, ultimately, the emergence of life approximately 3.7 billion years ago.</p>

<h2>Observational Evidence and Confirmations</h2>
<h3>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)</h3>
<p><img src="https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/121238/ilc_9yr_moll4096.png" alt="CMB Anisotropy Map" title="Planck CMB Temperature Anisotropies"><br>
The <strong>cosmic microwave background</strong>, discovered serendipitously by Penzias and Wilson in 1965, provides the most compelling evidence for the Big Bang model. This nearly isotropic radiation bath, now cooled to 2.725 K, exhibits minute temperature fluctuations of approximately 18 μK that correspond to density variations in the early universe. Detailed measurements by the Planck satellite reveal an angular power spectrum that precisely matches theoretical predictions, constraining key cosmological parameters like the universe's density composition (5% ordinary matter, 27% dark matter, 68% dark energy) and flat geometry to unprecedented accuracy.</p>
<h3>Hubble Expansion and Elemental Abundances</h3>
<p>The <strong>cosmological redshift</strong> of distant galaxies, quantified by Edwin Hubble's relation <code>v = H₀ × d</code> (where <code>H₀ ≈ 67.4 km/s/Mpc</code> from Planck data), demonstrates the ongoing metric expansion of space. Observations of Type Ia supernovae at high redshifts revealed the unexpected acceleration of this expansion, attributed to dark energy. Additionally, <strong>Big Bang nucleosynthesis</strong> calculations successfully predict the primordial abundances of light elements: approximately 75% hydrogen-1, 25% helium-4 by mass, with trace amounts of deuterium, helium-3, and lithium-7—values confirmed through spectroscopic studies of pristine gas clouds and stellar atmospheres.</p>

<h2>Unsolved Mysteries and Open Questions</h2>
<p>Despite its remarkable successes, the ΛCDM model leaves several fundamental questions unresolved. The <strong>nature of dark matter</strong>, which constitutes 85% of all matter content, remains elusive—whether it consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions, or other exotic particles is still undetermined. The mechanism driving <strong>cosmic inflation</strong>, while strongly supported by CMB observations, lacks direct experimental verification. Furthermore, the <strong>cosmological constant problem</strong> highlights the staggering discrepancy (10¹²⁰ orders of magnitude) between the predicted vacuum energy density from quantum field theory and the observed value of dark energy. Alternative models like modified gravity (MOND) and cyclic cosmologies continue to be explored, though none yet match the explanatory power of the inflationary Big Bang paradigm.</p>
